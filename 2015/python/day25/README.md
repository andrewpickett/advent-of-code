# Approach
### Data format

Read the input file and get the row/column from the single line of text. I store it as a tuple so that I can just
reference those values whenever I need.

### Part 1
> _What is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?_

Just do exactly what it says, step by step. Not too difficult.

### Part 2
> _Now, what is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?_

Merry Christmas!
