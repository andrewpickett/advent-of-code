# Overview
This year, I am planning on solving all of the puzzles in Python initially. I had a lot of
fun learning it last year, but haven't had much time to continue using it regularly, so this
will give me an excuse to dive back into the language.

I am also planning on solving most of the puzzles in core Java as that's the language I know the
best, but again, I have fallen a little out of touch with newer features. Each day's puzzle
will have a README to talk about my approach to the puzzle and any issues I ran into. If you look
at the Python implementation's README, it will also include some stats on how many tries it took me,
how long it took me, etc.

I will be writing the execution time of all of my solutions, just because I'm curious the speed
of both different languages.

If I get around to it, I may try some other languages, like Go, Rust, or something like that.

If I get REALLY ambitious, I may build a UI/Rest service to run each puzzle in whatever language...but we'll see.
