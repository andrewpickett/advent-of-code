# Approach
### Part 1
> _Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?_

Just like all of the previous years, this first puzzle was extremely basic.
There was no reason to get really clever or tricky on the first pass,
so I just brute forced the solution:
iterate through each pair of numbers and check their sum.

The biggest hiccup today was the site was clearly not ready for the on-rush of fast
submissions this year. I finished part 1 in about 30 seconds, but received 504 and 503
errors every time I submitted for about 6 minutes.

After about 6 minutes, my answer finally submitted and I moved to part 2.

### Part 2
> _...what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?_

Part 2 was just another straightforward extension on part one.
Once again, I decided to just brute force it with 3 loops.
I g the answer in about a minute and successfully finished Day 1!
