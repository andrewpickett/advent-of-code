# Approach
### Data format

We need to read the input into 2 lists -- the first number on each line, and the second number on each line. Go ahead
and sort the two lists as part of this step as well while we're at it...

### Part 1
> _What is the total distance between your lists?_




### Part 2
> _What is their similarity score?_
