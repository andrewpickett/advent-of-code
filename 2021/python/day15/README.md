# Approach
### Part 1
> _What is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the bottom right?_

Ugh...Right when I started reading this, I knew it was going to be graph traversal. I hate graph traversal.

I didn't really hesitate and decided to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm. It had been a little while since I had thought
through the algorithm, but I drew out a graph and started re-figuring it out. Once I had it back in my head, I
started hacking down the code and ran it on the example given. It came back in about 10ms, so I figured it was pretty good!

Well, I ran it on the actual input (which was 100 times larger!)...and it took over a minute to come back, but it did
and gave me the correct answer. So I just brushed it off and decided to see what part two contained...

### Part 2
> _Using the full map, what is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the bottom right?_

Take that input that was already 100 times larger than the examples, and multiply it by 25...are you serious?!?!

Well, I first built the expanded data array (which I feel is probably not necessary, somehow) and kicked off my
Dijkstra's algorithm on the example. It took well over 6 seconds to come back. So by my super rough estimates for
how long the actual input would take, I figured it would take my algorithm something like 10 hours to complete.

Obviously I wasn't going to do that...

So I then set off to try to remember some of the other graph traversal algorithms I learned back in college (way too many
years ago). I could only remember one: A*

I only very vaguely remembered the implementation details for it, so I did look it up and read about it again. I worked
through some examples on pen/paper and once I had a grasp on how it worked, hacked away at the code. I initially
just created an h-function (Heuristic function) that just used "1" for the value for all nodes, knowing it could be
improved.

Amazingly, the first time I ran it on the sample input, I got the correct answers. My times dropped by a factor of 20-30
on the sample input, so, again, I estimated it might take 20-30 minutes to run on the main input.

I decided to kick it off while I tried to figure out other approaches.

It was getting late at this point (1:20am), and I decided to just stop for the night and head to bed. My code had been
running for about 15 minutes and I was just going to shut it down, but right when I was about to close my computer,
it returned a value...and it was correct!

So I got my star and went to bed. I did then go back and change my h function a little and add a couple small performance
tweaks to the A* algorithm...finally got the code to run in about 6 minutes.

Definitely not happy with it, I feel like there's a trick or different approach all together I should have done, but
as I mentioned at the top: I hate graph traversals. So I'm just going to close the book on this one and call it done.

I did leave my Dijkstra's algorithm code in the source as reference...but it's not actually used anymore.

# Original puzzle

### --- Day 15: Chiton ---
You've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting closer together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.

The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of risk level throughout the cave (your puzzle input). For example:
```
1163751742
1381373672
2136511328
3694931569
7463417111
1319128137
1359912421
3125421639
1293138521
2311944581
```
You start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right position, and you cannot move diagonally. The number at each position is its risk level; to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels of each position you enter (that is, don't count the risk level of your starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your total).

Your goal is to find a path with the lowest total risk. In this example, a path with the lowest total risk is highlighted here:
```
1163751742
1381373672
2136511328
3694931569
7463417111
1319128137
1359912421
3125421639
1293138521
2311944581
```
The total risk of this path is `40` (the starting position is never entered, so its risk is not counted).

What is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the bottom right?

### --- Part Two ---
Now that you know how to find low-risk paths in the cave, you can try to find your way out.

The entire cave is actually five times larger in both dimensions than you thought; the area you originally scanned is just one tile in a 5x5 tile area that forms the full map. Your original map tile repeats to the right and downward; each time the tile repeats to the right or downward, all of its risk levels are 1 higher than the tile immediately up or left of it. However, risk levels above 9 wrap back around to 1. So, if your original map had some position with a risk level of `8`, then that same position on each of the 25 total tiles would be as follows:
```
8 9 1 2 3
9 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6 7
```
Each single digit above corresponds to the example position with a value of 8 on the top-left tile. Because the full map is actually five times larger in both dimensions, that position appears a total of 25 times, once in each duplicated tile, with the values shown above.

Here is the full five-times-as-large version of the first example above, with the original map in the top left corner highlighted:

The total risk of this path is `315` (the starting position is still never entered, so its risk is not counted).

Using the full map, what is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the bottom right?
