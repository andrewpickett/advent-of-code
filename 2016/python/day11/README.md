# Approach
### Part 1
> _In your situation, what is the minimum number of steps required to bring all of the objects to the fourth floor?_

...I solved it by hand. I think I get how to do it (using some sort of Dijkstra or A* to traverse ahead and start figuring
out the "shortest" solve...obviously stopping the process if it's a state I've seen before as that would cause infinite loops).
I started writing things up, and kept fumbling up on it, so I sat down and decided to see
if I could just solve it by hand. Sure enough, in about 10 minutes, I had what I thought was the right answer. I plugged it
in, and it was right.

So, I do need to go back to this one and actually code it up. It reminds me a lot of a Towers of Hanoi type of problem...
Pretty simple to actually solve by hand, but writing the code is not as easy as you'd think...

### Part 2
> _What is the minimum number of steps required to bring all of the objects, including these four new ones, to the fourth floor?_

Yeah, same thing. It took a little longer, but solving by hand worked just fine here...
